Score: {score}

Reference Information (Past Attempts):

Goal: Critique the Current Text. Use the Reference Information to identify what high-scoring texts have in common or what low-scoring texts missed.
Provide a clear, actionable "Gradient" (instruction) on how to modify the text to improve it.

Note: The score is on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.

Important: Any improvement suggestion MUST be achievable within the task constraints (e.g. word count).
