{constraint}

Task Definition: "{task_def}"

Current Text:
"{target_text}"

Score: {score}

Goal: Critique the Current Text strictly. Identify specific weaknesses that prevent it from achieving a higher score.
Provide a clear, actionable "Gradient" (instruction) on how to modify the text to improve it.

Note: The score is on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.

Important: Any improvement suggestion MUST be achievable within the task constraints (e.g. word count).

Constraint 1: The Gradient itself MUST be concise. MAXIMUM {gradient_max_words} WORDS.
Constraint 2: The improvement must be feasible within the target text's length constraint (e.g. 19 words).
Constraint 3: Do NOT provide the full rewritten text. Provide only the instruction/direction.
Do not ask for "specific examples" or "detailed reasons" if they cannot fit.
Do not waste words on politeness. Be direct.
