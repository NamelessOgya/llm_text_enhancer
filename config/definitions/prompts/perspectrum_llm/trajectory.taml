Task Definition: "{task_def}"

I have a sequence of texts generated for this task, sorted by their quality score (low to high).
Your goal is to identify the pattern of improvement and generate the NEXT, SUPERIOR version of the text.

Optimization Trajectory:
{trajectory_text}

Note: The score is on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.

Directive:
Analyze the improvements made in the trajectory.
Generate a new text that is strictly better than the last version in the trajectory.
Output ONLY the new text.
